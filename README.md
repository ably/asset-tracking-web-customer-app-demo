## Overview

This demo presents a mock customer-facing app with functionality matching that expected for the typical use case for
[Ably's Asset Tracking solution](https://ably.com/solutions/asset-tracking),
being the tracking of a delivery being made to that customer, where that customer is using a Web browser.
Such deliveries could be food, groceries or other packages ordered for home delivery.

This app is a member of our
[suite of **Ably Asset Tracking Demos**](https://github.com/ably/asset-tracking-demos),
developed by Ably's SDK Team to demonstrate best practice for adopting and deploying Asset Tracking.
